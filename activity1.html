         Fundamentals, you will be doing activities and seeing code during lecture. To provide a common
         place for this, Alan will use me github account to provide you with centralized place fo find all of <thead>
         material. This first activity is to see if you can correctly identify which tags to use for different
         HTML, content, don't worry about the CSS doing the
         styling. If you put the correct label tags and give
         them the correct PCS relationships, this page should
         come to life pretty neatly.
